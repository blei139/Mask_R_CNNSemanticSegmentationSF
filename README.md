# Mask_R_CNNSemanticSegmentationSF
Mask R-CNN semantic segmentation is very interesting.  According to "Semantic Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Networks over the 
Years", written by meetshah1995, it is simple to to train and easy to generalize.  I like the brilliant colors painted over the detected
objects.  

The Mask R-CNN uses faster R-CNN with ResNet architecture to perform semantic segmentation.  The Rolalign operation keeps 
spatial-features intact in the highest resolution for semantic segmentation.  It combines with Feature Pyramid Networks to achieve 
state-of-the-art results when it is trained on the MS COCO dataset.
